# Passt
My Java Spring Boot internship.

During my internship I made a Java Spring Boot Authentication manager that uses OAuth2.0. The goal was to make this as secure as can be, this way it could be used to explain security concepts to young-graduates.

This project contains these following applications:
- [Passt-sp](Passt-sp) is the resource server written in Java Spring Boot.
- [Passt-idp](Passt-idp) is the authorization server written in Java Spring Boot.
- [Passt-frontend](Passt-frontend) is an Angular application that utilizes above servers, written in Angular.
