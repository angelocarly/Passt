# Passt
My Java Spring Boot internship.

During my internship I made a Java Spring Boot Authentication manager that uses OAuth2.0.

- [Passt-sp](Passt-sp) is the resource server.
- [Passt-idp](Passt-idp) is the authorization server.
- [Passt-frontend](Passt-frontend) is an Angular application that utilizes above servers.
